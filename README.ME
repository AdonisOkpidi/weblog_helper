# Command line script called weblog_helper that provide ability to search log file

In the file https://s3.amazonaws.com/syseng-challenge/public_access.log.txt, you'll find a standard HTTP access log ... something that we all need to parse from time to time, usually in the heat of an outage. 
For this challenge, please create a command line script called weblog_helper that can provide the two features listed below. Each feature should build on the previous implementation. 
We realise that you can do a lot of these pretty quickly with UNIX utilities (e.g. bash, sed, awk, cut) but we'd prefer you to use a higher level scripting language instead (eg Ruby, Python, Perl - whatever language you feel strongest in). Write it as if you would be proud for another engineer to peer-review it before committing it to our tools :) 

## Feature 1: Return all log lines that correspond to a given source IP address by adding switch (--ip <IP>) that restricts the output to the given IP address: 
```
Example
$ ./weblog_helper --ip 178.93.28.59 
```

## Feature 2: Return all log lines that correspond to a given IP CIDR network ( e.g. 180.76.15.0/24) by adding the --ip switch to handle CIDR ranges with the use of Network address libraries. 
```
Example: 
$ ./weblog_helper --ip 180.76.15.0/24 
```
